# Wildlife-role-in-the-transmission-of-trypanosomiasis-in-livestock-in-Shimba-Hills-National-Reserve.

## INTRODUCTION ##

Animal African trypanosomiasis(AAT) is a fatal livestock disease in Africa, caused by trypanosomes(Trypanosoma) transmitted by tsetse flies. AAT has adverse effects on livestock such as anemia, infertility, reduced reproduction, abortions, and enlargement of superficial lymph among others. Wild animals are thought to act as the reservoir for AAT in livestock. The Shimba Hills National Reserve provides a unique environment where wild animals and livestock interact, creating an opportunity for sylvatic transmission of trypanosomiasis. In this region, different tsetse species expose herds to trypanosomiasis, making control efforts challenging as infected animals often go unnoticed and untreated.  This study is essential in developing better control strategies for AAT for the health of livestock which many people depend on as a source of livelihood therefore it has a direct impact on local agriculture and economic stability

## BACKGROUND ##

African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT) disease is a disease cyclically transmitted by tsetse flies (genus Glossina) and has primary species responsible which are Trypanosoma congolense, Trypanosoma vivax, and Trypanosoma brucei. These parasites replicate within tsetse flies and are transmitted through the flies' saliva when they feed on animals. The main tsetse fly species involved in transmission belong to three groups: morsitans, palpalis, and fusca, each preferring different habitats such as open woodlands, shaded areas near water bodies, and forests.

Despite the general resistance of wild animals to clinical trypanosomiasis, they frequently harbor asymptomatic trypanosome infections. These hidden infections position wildlife as significant reservoirs for AAT, posing a risk to livestock through sylvatic transmission. Understanding this transmission route is crucial, particularly in areas like the Shimba Hills National Reserve in Kenya, where wildlife and livestock coexist closely.

The clinical impacts of AAT ultimately lead to high mortality if left untreated. Immunologic lesions and anemia are significant in trypanosomiasis, leading to immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to secondary infections, often causing death. The primary clinical sign is anemia, particularly in infections caused by T. congolense and T. vivax. Trypanosoma congolense which is the specific focus of this study is expressed in most domestic mammals: cattle, sheep, goats, horses, pigs, camels, and dogs; and also in many wild animals. Recent studies have explored physiological and pathological changes in blood levels in animals experimentally infected with trypanosomiasis, emphasizing the importance of monitoring hematological and biochemical parameters to assess animal health and control the infection.

This project aims to investigate the role of sylvatic transmission in AAT affecting livestock by quantifying wildlife-to-livestock transmission in the Shimba Hills National Reserve. By using flies collected within and outside the park as a proxy, Whole-genome sequence data from 34 Trypanosoma congolense was isolated from host blood (livestock) and 81 from tsetse flies to provide insights into how wildlife contributes to the spread of trypanosomiasis to livestock, thereby informing better control strategies to enhance livestock productivity and food security in affected areas

## OBJECTIVES ##
### Main Objective ###

- To quantify wildlife-to-livestock transmission of AAT in Shimba Hills National Reserve using flies collected from within and outside the park as a proxy.
### Specific Objectives

1. To identify and analyze the presence of trypanosome parasites in flies collected from different areas within and around Shimba Hills National Reserve.
2. To compare the prevalence of trypanosome infections in flies collected from inside the reserve versus those from livestock farming areas.
3. To assess the potential role of different wildlife species as reservoirs of trypanosome parasites.
4. To evaluate the genetic diversity of trypanosome parasites found in wildlife and livestock to understand transmission dynamics.
### Expected Outcomes

- Understanding of the role of wildlife in the transmission of AAT.
- Inform better control strategies to reduce AAT in livestock.
- Understand the genetic relationships between trypanosome parasites in wildlife and livestock.
